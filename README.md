# Rain_Prediction_in_Australia
The provided code is a Python script for predicting rain using various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The dataset is preprocessed, including one-hot encoding categorical variables and converting binary labels. The script then trains each model, evaluates their performance, and prints key metrics such as accuracy, Jaccard index, F1 score, and log loss (if applicable). It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation for different algorithms. The results are organized into a DataFrame and printed for easy interpretation. This script serves as a comprehensive example for predicting rain based on weather features, making it suitable for a GitHub repository focused on machine learning and data science projects.
